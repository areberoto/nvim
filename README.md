# My Dev Environment Configuration for Neovim ðŸš€

This configuration is based on and inspired by [josean-dev](https://github.com/josean-dev). Clone this repository under `~/.config/`. The path should be `~/.config/nvim/`

## Tmux navigator

This configuration is compatible with Tmux (plugin: [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator)). It allows you to navigate seamlessly between vim and tmux splits using a consistent set of hotkeys.

**NOTE**: This requires tmux v1.8 or higher.

The plugin provides the following mappings:

- `<ctrl-h>` => Left
- `<ctrl-j>` => Down
- `<ctrl-k>` => Up
- `<ctrl-l>` => Right
- `<ctrl-\>` => Previous split

## Font

I use the "Hack Nerd Font Mono", which can be obtained at: [NERD FONTS](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

## Keymaps
